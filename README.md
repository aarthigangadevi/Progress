# Python Practice Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various Python scripts and exercises, covering fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), functions, and basic algorithms.

## Projects Included

### 1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **). It includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

### 2. Multiple Choice Test
A quiz program using the `Question` class to create a multiple-choice test. The program checks user answers and calculates the score.
